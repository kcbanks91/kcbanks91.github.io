<h3 class="greeting">Hi, I'm Katharine</h3>

<p>
Iâ€™m a Chicago based graphic designer, documentary enthusiast, world traveler of 11 countries, and Master's Candidate in HCI at DePaul University.
</p>
<p>
Like most people, I am striving to become better at my craft and trying to put a small (but deep!) dent in my corner of the universe. I made this site to showcase examples of my work as well as give information on my past experience.
</p>
<p>
So take a look around and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like additional information!
